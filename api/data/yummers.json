Remove to a bowl and pour the remaining oil into the pan. Once hot, tip in the onion with a pinch of salt and fry for 5-7 mins until just softened before stirring in the peppers and courgettes. Cook for a further 15-17 mins until lightly browned then add the garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes until fragrant. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and allow it to caramelise for 5 mins. Pour in the cooked aubergine, tomatoes, basil stems and half of the basil leaves. Bring to a gentle simmer. Leave to bubble away for 20-25 mins, then season to taste."
